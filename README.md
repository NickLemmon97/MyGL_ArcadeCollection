# atfGL Framework
An in progress framework using C++17 to practice OpenGL and framework setup with the intent to make small games. 
A comfortable environtment for me to create what I want in the way I want to

# Building
Requires Premake5 (I have put it in my environment variables, you may need to download it)

run PremakeGenerateBuildFiles.bat to generate a vs2019 project

# Build Note
The current state of the project assumes vs2019. 
The supplied glfw and glew dll and libs are only compatible with vs2019, as that is how I am creating the project
